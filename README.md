recognize Geez numbers from images. The model is trained on a dataset of images of Geez numbers, and then it can be used to predict 
the number in an image. first Learning the Machine or the Computer with a Dataset and second make test that, 
Machine or Computer is correctly train or not based on train_set and test_set with the geez number image from geez_numbers, 
prediction and test directory
